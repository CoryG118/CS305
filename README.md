In this assignement, I tested and verified security for a financial company called Artimis Financial. They specifically wanted me to find potential issues, 
recommend fixes, and implement an encryption cipher to protect data. To make sure I found everything, I used a Maven check by adding the plugin to the pom.xml
file. Correctly implementing these secuirty measures allows for systems to be fortified against hackers and unauthorized users. The most challenging for me was
creating a self signed certificate. What made it so difficult was both my computers failed to recognize the keytool in java, resuling in my having to delete and 
re-install java.
